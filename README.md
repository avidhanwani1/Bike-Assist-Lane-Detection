# Bike-Assist-Lane-Detection


I usually ride a bike around campus and noticed that I cannot keep track of the bike lanes. Therefore, I recorded a video of the bike lane while riding and programmed lane detection using OpenCV and MoviePy.

Once the camera is calibrated and object detection is implemented in the code, it can also be used to detect car lanes for self-driving/riding.
