# Bike-Assist-Lane-Detection

I usually ride bike and noticed that I cannot keep track on the bike lanes. Therefore, I recorded a video of bike lane while riding and programmed lane detection usuing OpenCV and MoviePy.

This code can further be improved through calibrating camera and implementing object detection for safe riding. 

Once camera is calibrated and object detection is implemented in the code, it can also be used to detect car lanes for self-driving/riding.
